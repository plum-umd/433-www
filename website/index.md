CMSC 433: Programming Language Technologies and Paradigms

Spring 2024

[Quiz](code/quizsingle.pdf)

**Lectures:**  
Tuesday & Thursday, 3.30pm Eastern - 4.45pm Eastern  
CSI 1115


**Description:**
Students will be introduced to a range of modern formal methods and
software engineering practices, focusing on
[Dafny](http://dafny.org/) and [Haskell](http://haskell.org/).
The first part of the course will look at Dafny, a verification-aware
programming language that is used heavily at Amazon: students will
learn different techniques for writing down precise specifications of
desired system behavior and for proving that specifications hold of
software artifacts. The second part of the course will focus on Haskell,
with the goal of implementing a miniature version of Dafny split up in
different exercises throughout the course of the semester. Knowledge
of functional programming in the form of OCaml (from 330) is assumed,
but not prior knowledge of Haskell or Dafny.

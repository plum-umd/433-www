# Prerequisites and Description

**Prerequisite:** a grade of C or better in CMSC330 or permission
of instructor.

**Credits:** 3.

**Description:**
Students will be introduced to a range of modern formal methods and
software engineering practices, focusing on
[Dafny]("http://dafny.org/") and [Haskell]("http://haskell.org/").
The first part of the course will look at Dafny, a verification-aware
programming language that is used heavily at Amazon: students will
learn different techniques for writing down precise specifications of
desired system behavior and for proving that specifications hold of
software artifacts. The second part of the course will focus on Haskell,
with the goal of implementing a miniature version of Dafny split up in
different exercises throughout the course of the semester. Knowledge
of functional programming in the form of OCaml (from 330) is assumed,
but not prior knowledge of Haskell or Dafny.

# Course Workflow

The course will be based on live lectures and discussion.
The main forms of communication will be ELMS (for main course
announcements and grades) and Discord.

The discord server is there for you to organize as a class, ask
questions of each other, and to get help from staff. That said, feel
free to use the discord for discussion. I (Leo) will check
periodically, but if you would like to ask a question directly to the
course staff, office hours and email remain the prioritized forms of
communication.

There is a channel '#course-discussion' that is meant for
discussion/questions/help regarding the material of the course, make sure that
you keep that channel free from noise so that other students and course staff
can easily see what issues are being brought up.

Discord invites will be sent out via ELMS announcement in the first
week of classes.  Ask the instructor or the TAs for invites if you
haven't received one. Make sure that your 'nickname' is set to
something appropriate for class.

# Office Hours

Office hours format will be announced closer to the start of the semster.

# Topics 

The following list of lecture topics will vary according to the pace
of the course:

- Dafny
- Specifications with Dafny
- Hoare Triples/Verification Conditions
- Verification with Dafny
- From OCaml to Haskell
- Monads
- Parsing/Printing/State
- Property-Based Testing with QuickCheck
- Implementing (mini)Dafny

# Grading

Grades will be maintained on ELMS.

You are responsible for all material discussed in lecture and posted
on the class web page, including announcements, deadlines, policies,
etc.

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
percentages:

| Component | Percentage |
| :--------- | :----------: |
| Assignments | 50% |
| Quizzes & Surveys | 10% |
| Midterm | 25% |
| Final Project | 15% |

# Assignments

There will be several programming assignments, often with full week
given for completion and submission (e.g. if it assigned on a Tuesday it will
be due the following Tuesday at 11:59pm EST unless otherwise noted).

Up to two assignments throughout the semester will be accepted 2 days
late no questions asked. Given the nature of the semester, additional
accommodations can be granted --- reach out to the instructor.

Assignments will be submitted through Gradescope.

# Quizzes & surveys

There will be **many** quizzes and surveys. These will be administered
through ELMS.  Completed surveys receive full credit.  Instructors reserve the
right to reject survey responses that are not considered thoughtful.

# Midterms 

There will be one Midterm.  

# Project

There will be a course project that will be assessed during the final
exam period for the course. It will constitute of putting together all
of the (independent) semester assignments to get an end-to-end
implementation of mini Dafny. The full project description will be
distributed approximately a month before the due date.

# Gradescope

Programming projects can be developed on your own system and subitted
via Gradescope, which will provide virtual machines suitably
configured for running your code.  All project submissions **must**
work correctly on the Gradescope VMs, and your projects will be graded
solely based on their results on those machines. Because language and
library versions may vary with the installation, in unfortunate
circumstances a program might work perfectly on your system but not
work at all on the VMs. Thus we strongly recommend that as you develop
any project, you should run it **several days early** on Gradescope
to have time to address any compatibility problems.

# Outside-of-class communication with course staff

Course staff will interact with students outside of class in primarily two
ways: office hours, and electronically via e-mail.  The use of Discord and/or
other classroom forums is allowed, and discussion amongst the students is
encouraged, as long as the discuss is *about the concepts* and not
*the solutions*. The majority of communication should be via office
hours.

Personalized assistance, e.g., with assignments or exam preparation,
will be provided during office hours.  Office hours for the
instructional staff will be posted on the course web page.

Additional assistance will provided via the ELMS class discussion forum. You
may use this forum to ask general questions of interest to the class as a
whole, e.g., administrative issues or problem set clarification questions. The
course staff will monitor ELMS on a daily basis, but do not expect immediate
answers to questions. Please do not post publicly any information that would
violate the university academic integrity policy (e.g., problem set code).

ELMS allows students to send private questions that are only visible
to instructors. Please use this feature if you wish to ask specific
questions concerning your assignment solutions.

Personal e-mail to TAs should be reserved for issues
that cannot be handled by the above methods.

Important announcements will be made in class or on the class web
page, and via ELMS.

# Excused Absences

Missing an **exam** for reasons such as illness, religious
observance, participation in required university activities, or family
or personal emergency (such as a serious automobile accident or close
relative's funeral) will be excused so long as the absence is
requested in writing at least **2 days** in advance and the student
includes documentation that shows the absence qualifies as excused;
**a self-signed note** is not sufficient as exams are Major
Scheduled Grading Events. For this class, such events are the final
project assessment and midterm, which will be due on the following
dates:

- Midterm: TBD
- Final Project: TBD

For medical absences, you must furnish documentation from the health
care professional who treated you. This documentation must verify
dates of treatment and indicate the timeframe that the student was
unable to meet academic responsibilities. In addition, it must contain
the name and phone number of the medical service provider to be used
if verification is needed. No diagnostic information will ever be
requested. Note that simply being seen by a health care professional
does not constitute an excused absence; it must be clear that you were
unable to perform your academic duties.

It is the University's policy to provide accommodations for students
with religious observances conflicting with exams, but it is the your
responsibility to inform the instructor in advance of intended
religious observances. If you have a conflict with one of the planned
exams, you **must** inform the instructor prior to the end of the
first two weeks of the class.

For missed exams due to excused absences, the instructor will arrange
a makeup exam. If you might miss an exam for any other reason other
than those above, you must contact the instructor **in advance** to
discuss the circumstances. We are not obligated to offer a substitute
assignment or to provide a makeup exam unless the failure to perform
was due to an excused absence.

The policies for excused absences **do not** apply to project
assignments. Projects will be assigned with sufficient time to be
completed by students who have a reasonable understanding of the
necessary material and begin promptly. In cases of **extremely
serious** documented illness of **lengthy duration** or other
protracted, severe emergency situations, the instructor may consider
extensions on project assignments, depending upon the specific
circumstances.

Besides the policies in this syllabus, the University's policies apply
during the semester. Various policies that may be relevant appear in
the [Undergraduate Catalog](http://www.umd.edu/catalog).

If you experience difficulty during the semester keeping up with the
academic demands of your courses, you may consider contacting the
Learning Assistance Service in 2201 Shoemaker Building at (301)
314-7693. Their educational counselors can help with time management
issues, reading, note-taking, and exam preparation skills.

# Students with Disabilities

Students with disabilities who have been certified by Disability
Support Services as needing any type of special accommodations should
see the instructor as soon as possible during the schedule adjustment
period (the first two weeks of class). Please provide DSS's letter of
accommodation to the instructor at that time.

All arrangements for exam accommodations as a result of disability
**must** be made and arranged with the instructor **at least**
three business days prior to the exam date; later requests (including
retroactive ones) will be refused.

# University of Maryland Policies for Undergraduate Students

Please read the university's guide on [Course Related
Policies](https://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html"), which
provides you with resources and information relevant to your
participation in a UMD course.

# Academic Integrity

The Campus Senate has adopted a policy asking students to include the
following statement on each examination or assignment in every course:
"I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any
unauthorized assistance on this examination (or assignment)."
Consequently, you will be requested to include this pledge on each
exam and assignment. Please also carefully read the Office of
Information Technology's [policy](http://www.nethics.umd.edu/aup/)
regarding acceptable use of computer accounts.

Assignments and projects are to be completed **individually**,
therefore cooperation with others or use of unauthorized materials on
assignment or projects is a violation of the University's Code of
Academic Integrity. Both the person receiving assistance @bold{and the
person providing assistance} are in violation of the honor
code. **Any evidence** of this, or of unacceptable use of computer
accounts, use of unauthorized materials or cooperation on exams or
quizzes, or other possible violations of the Honor Code, **will be
submitted** to the Student Honor Council, which could result in an XF
for the course, suspension, or expulsion.

- For learning the course concepts, students are welcome to study
  together or to receive help from anyone else. You may discuss with
  others the assignment or project requirements, the features of the
  programming languages used, what was discussed in class and in the
  class web forum, and general syntax errors. Examples of questions that
  would be allowed are "Does a cond expression always end with an
  else-clause?"  or "What does a 'mismatched parenthesis' error
  indicate?", because they convey no information about the contents of an
  assignment.

- When it comes to actually writing an assignment, other than help
  from the instructional staff, assignments must solely and entirely be
  your own work.  Working with another student or individual, or using
  anyone else's work **in any way** except as noted in this
  paragraph, is a violation of the code of academic integrity and
  **will be reported** to the Honor Council. You may not discuss
  design of any part of an assignment with anyone except the instructor
  and teaching assistants. Examples of questions you may @bold{not} ask
  others might be "How did you implement this part of the assignment?"
  or "Please look at my code and help me find my stupid syntax
  error!". You may not use any disallowed source of information in
  creating either the design or code. When writing assignment you are
  free to use ideas or **short fragments** of code from
  **published** textbooks or **publicly available** information,
  but the specific source must be cited in a comment in the relevant
  section of the program. 

**Violations of the Code of Academic Integrity may include, but
are not limited to:**


- Failing to do all or any of the work on a project by yourself,
  other than assistance from the instructional staff.

- Using any ideas or any part of another person's project, or copying
  any other individual's work in any way.

- Giving any parts or ideas from your project, including test data, to
  another student.

- Allowing any other students access to your program on any computer
  system.

- Posting solutions to your projects to publicly-accessible sites,
  e.g., on github.

- Transferring any part of an assignment or project to or from another
  student or individual by any means, electronic or otherwise.

If you have any question about a particular situation or source then
consult with the instructors in advance. Should you have difficulty
with a programming assignment you should **see the instructional
staff in office hours**, and not solicit help from anyone else in
violation of these rules.

**It is the responsibility, under the honor policy, of anyone who
suspects an incident of academic dishonesty has occurred to report it
to their instructor, or directly to the Honor Council.**

Every semester the department has discovered a number of students
attempting to cheat on assignments, in violation of academic integrity
requirements. Students' academic careers have been significantly
affected by a decision to cheat. Think about whether you want to join
them before contemplating cheating, or before helping a friend to
cheat.

You may not share, discuss, or compare assignment solutions even after
they have been graded since later assignments may build upon earlier
solutions.


# Course Evaluations

If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don't hesitate to
tell the instructor or TAs during the semester. At the end of the
semester, please don't forget to provide your feedback using the
campus-wide [CourseEvalUM](https://www.courseevalum.umd.edu/)
system. Your comments will help make this class better.

# Right to Change Information

Although every effort has been made to be complete and accurate,
unforeseen circumstances arising during the semester could require the
adjustment of any material given here. Consequently, given due notice
to students, the instructors reserve the right to change any
information on this syllabus or in other course materials.  Such
changes will be announced and prominently displayed at the top of the
syllabus.

# Course Materials

Portions of the course materials are based on material developed by
Stephanie Weirich.

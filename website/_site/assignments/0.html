            <h1>Assignment 0 - Installations!</h1>
            <h1 id="goal">Goal</h1>
<p>In this project you will install software for the programming projects in this class.</p>
<h1 id="due">Due</h1>
<p>Fri. 2024-02-02 11:59:59 pm Perfect Score: 20 points</p>
<p>You will submit your solutions to this project on Gradescope.</p>
<h1 id="parts-of-the-assignment.">Parts of the assignment.</h1>
<h2 id="install-dafny">Install Dafny</h2>
<p>Directions may be found on the CMSC 433 Dafny part of the <a href="../resources.html">Resources</a> page. You should install Dafny and set up an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to use with it, then run the <a href="../code/hello-world.dfy">test program</a> to confirm that your installation succeeded. (You should see “Hello world!” printed out.)</p>
<h2 id="install-haskell">Install Haskell</h2>
<p>Directions may be found the CMSC 433 Haskell part of the <a href="../resources.html">Resources</a> page. You should install Haskell and (optionally) IDE support, and then run <code>stack new</code> and <code>stack run</code>.</p>
<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>
<p>You must fill the two textbox fields on Gradescope with your “solutions” to each of the two parts above. A “solution” in this case can either be just “Installation succeeded” or a “Had some difficulty.” In the latter case, a brief description of the issues you encountered would be greatly appreciated. Please note: you will not lose any points if you had difficulties with the installation process! Scanned, hand-written solutions are also perfectly acceptable.</p>

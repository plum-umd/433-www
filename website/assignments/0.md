title: Assignment 0 - Installations!
---

Goal: In this project you will install software for the programming projects in this class.

Due: Fri. 2024-02-02 11:59:59 pm
Perfect Score: 20 points

You will submit your solutions to this project as a single .pdf file in Gradescope.

Parts of the assignment.

1. Install Dafny. Directions may be found on the CMSC 433 Dafny part
of the [Resources](resources.html) page. You should install Dafny
and set up an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to use with
it, then run the [test program](../code/hello-world.dfy) to confirm
that your installation succeeded.  (You should see “Hello world!”
printed out.)

2. Install Haskell. Directions may be found the CMSC 433 Haskell part
of the [Resources](resources.html) page. You should install Haskell
and (optionally) IDE support, and then run the [test
program](../code/hello-world.hs) to confirm that your installation
succeeded. (You should see “Hello world!” printed out.)

Submission. You must upload a single .pdf file to Gradescope
containing your “solutions” to each of the two parts above. A
“solution” in this case can either be just “Installation succeeded” or
a “Had some difficulty.” In the latter case, a brief description of
the issues you encountered would be greatly appreciated. Please note:
you will not lose any points if you had difficulties with the
installation process! Scanned, hand-written solutions are also
perfectly acceptable.

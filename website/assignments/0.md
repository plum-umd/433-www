Perfect Score: 20 points

You will submit your solutions to this project on Gradescope.

# Parts of the assignment.

## Install Dafny

Directions may be found on the CMSC 433 Dafny part of the
[Resources](../resources.html) page. You should install Dafny and set
up an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) to use with it, then
run the [test program](../code/hello-world.dfy) to confirm that your
installation succeeded.  (You should see “Hello world!”  printed out.)

## Install Haskell

Directions may be found the CMSC 433 Haskell part
of the [Resources](../resources.html) page. You should install Haskell
and (optionally) IDE support, and then run `stack new` and `stack run`.

# Submission

You must fill the two textbox fields on Gradescope 
with your “solutions” to each of the two parts above. A
“solution” in this case can either be just “Installation succeeded” or
a “Had some difficulty.” In the latter case, a brief description of
the issues you encountered would be greatly appreciated. Please note:
you will not lose any points if you had difficulties with the
installation process! Scanned, hand-written solutions are also
perfectly acceptable.

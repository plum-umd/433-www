This assignment focuses on AVL trees and QuickCheck.

You should download
[hw03.zip](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/code/hw03.zip). This
contains the template for the exercise - the standard stack/cabal
boilerplate, as well as a Haskell file (AVL.hs). Fill in AVL.hs by
following their instructions and submit just that file through
Gradescope. 

As a reminder, you should take a look and follow the [style
guide](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/style.html).

The deadline for this is Wednesday, March 2nd, 11:59 pm Eastern.

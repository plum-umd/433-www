title: Assignment 3
---

This assignment focuses on Haskell basics. It consists of 5 problems:

- Style
- Basic Recursion over Lists
- Higher Order Functions
- Folds over Lists
- Trees

You should download
[hw03.zip](../code/hw03.zip). This
contains the template for the exercise - the standard stack/cabal
boilerplate plus a Main.hs file. Fill in Main.hs by following its
instructions and submit it (just Main.hs) through Gradescope.

As a reminder, you should take a look and follow the [style
guide](../style.html).

The deadline for this is next Friday, March 8th, 11:59 pm Eastern.
Since this HW was released late, you're free to use the late deadline
on Gradescope with no penalty.

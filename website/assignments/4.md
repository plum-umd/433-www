This assignment focuses on Regular Expressions and the List Monad.

You should download
[hw04.zip](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/code/hw04.zip). This
contains the template for the exercise - the standard stack/cabal
boilerplate, as well as a Haskell file (RegExp.hs). Fill in RegExp.hs by
following their instructions and submit just that file through
Gradescope. 

As a reminder, you should take a look and follow the [style
guide](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/style.html).

The deadline for this is Wednesday, March 17nd, 11:59 pm Eastern.

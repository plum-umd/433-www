This assignment introduces MiniDafny and focuses on pretty printing.t

You should download
[PrettyPrinting.zip](code/PrettyPrinting.zip). This contains the
template for the exercise - the standard stack/cabal boilerplate, as
well as a Haskell file (Syntax.hs). This file describes the Syntax of
MiniDafny, and begins to implement a pretty printer. Fill in Syntax.hs
by following its instructions and submit just that file through
Gradescope.

As a reminder, you should take a look and follow the [style
guide](style.html).

The deadline for this is Friday, March 15th, 11:59 pm Eastern.

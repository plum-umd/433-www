This assignment focuses on Haskell basics. It consists of 5 problems:

- Style

- Higher Order Functions
- Folds over Lists
- Trees

You should download
[hw01.zip](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/code/hw01.zip). This
contains the template for the exercise - the standard stack/cabal
boilerplate plus a Main.hs file. Fill in Main.hs by following its
instructions and submit it (just Main.hs) through Gradescope.

As a reminder, you should take a look and follow the [style
guide](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2022/cmsc488B/style.html).

The deadline for this is next Tuesday, February 8th, 11:59 pm Eastern.
